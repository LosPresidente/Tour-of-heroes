-this is a note page for me to know what is wat-
ng build to build the project
ng serve to start the project (localhost:4200)

Everything important is in 'src' folder
<name> component has a folder <name>, in a folder there are 4 files: HTML is what is appears like on the page, .ts is the logic
service <name>.service.ts which is where the logic happens

notable service is hero.service.ts - holds core logic including add, update and remove methods
in-memore-data.service(.ts) are fake servers to test api
rest of the files are just support files you don't have to worry about

process: in-memory-data.service.ts (mock-heroes.ts)  & hero.ts
